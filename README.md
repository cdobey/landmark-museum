## 🌟 Overview

Landmark Museum is an interactive web application that allows users to explore a virtual gallery showcasing famous landmarks from around the world. Unlike traditional static galleries, this project leverages **OpenAI's GPT models** to generate educational content on the fly and **Google's Custom Search API** to dynamically fetch relevant imagery.

The result is an infinite museum where every visit can be unique, driven by user curiosity.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **First-Person Exploration**: Fully immersive 3D environment with WASD movement and pointer-lock camera controls.
-   **Generative AI Content**: Enter any country name, and the museum curates an exhibit of its top 4 landmarks with AI-generated descriptions.
-   **Dynamic Asset Loading**: Real-time fetching of high-quality images for each landmark using the Google Custom Search API.
-   **Interactive 3D UI**: Diegetic user interface elements integrated directly into the 3D world (search panel, plaques).
-   **Polished Environment**: A rich, atmospheric setting featuring marble floors, architectural details, and dynamic lighting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
-   **3D Engine**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
-   **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o/GPT-3.5)
-   **Data Fetching**: Google Custom Search API

## 🏗️ Architecture

The codebase follows a modular, component-based architecture for maintainability and scalability:

-   **`src/World.js`**: The main controller that orchestrates the scene, physics, and game loop.
-   **`src/services/LandmarkService.js`**: Handles all external API interactions (OpenAI, Google), abstracting data fetching logic.
-   **`src/managers/UIManager.js`**: Manages the 2D overlay and 3D canvas-based user interfaces.
-   **`src/components/Environment.js`**: Encapsulates the procedural generation of the museum's geometry and lighting.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14 or higher)
-   An OpenAI API Key
-   A Google Custom Search API Key & Engine ID

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landmark-museum.git
    cd landmark-museum
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google keys (OpenAI key is entered in the UI):
    ```env
    VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_CX=your_search_engine_id
    ```

4.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
